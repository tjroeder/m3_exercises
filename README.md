# Mod 3 Exercises

A collection of exercises designed to provide an opportunity to practice skills without needing to spin up an entirely new Rails app.

### Set Up
1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/turingschool-examples/m3_exercises.git`

2. Navigate to the api_consumption directory.

  `cd api_consumption`

3. Run `bundle`

4. Run `rspec`

  You should see 5 errors. It is recommended that you focus one file at a time. To run a single file use the following command: `rspec spec/file_name_here`. Use the errors and failures to drive your development.
