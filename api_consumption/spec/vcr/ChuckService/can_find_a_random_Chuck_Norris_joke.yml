        Norris raced Sonic The Hedgehog and lost... by about 3 Planck time. Ok, so
        they didn''t race, but it''s an estimate... Sonic''s top speed: 45 miles per
        Planck time. Chuck Norris''s top speed: 89.728 miles per 2 Planck times. By
        the way, in case you''re wondering, one Planck time is 5.4 times 10-to-the-power-of-negative-44
        seconds. That''s how long it takes for light to travel one Planck LENGTH (16.162
        times 10-to-the-power-of-negative-36-meters). Therefore, Chuck Norris is faster
        than light, and only a bit slower than Sonic."}'
